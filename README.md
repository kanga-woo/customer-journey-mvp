# customer-journey-mvp
A SaaS-style platform that merges customer interactions from multiple touchpoints (website, email, support tickets, purchase history), visualizes their journey, scores churn risk in real time, and gives recommendations to retain them.
Subscription-based services, e-commerce, or SaaS businesses need to monitor customers holistically, identify signals of churn early (e.g. changes in usage, support tickets), then act (e.g. send offers, intervene via customer success). Tech stack: Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI), or Node.js Ingestion: APIs from web analytics (e.g. Google Analytics), email marketing tools (Mailchimp etc.), support tools (Zendesk, Intercom), and transactional DBs Data warehouse or lake: something like BigQuery or Snowflake (if available), or AWS Redshift / Snowflake in smaller scale Modeling: Feature engineering; churn risk model (logistic regression, gradient boosting like XGBoost), maybe survival analysis; possibly Natural Language Processing (NLP) on support ticket texts Frontend: React plus visualization via something like Vega / D3, charts of journey funnels, heatmaps, cohort analysis Notifications / automation: Send alerts or initiate email workflows (could be simulated) when customers cross risk thresholds Hosting / deployment: Cloud services; containerization; CI/CD; job scheduling; possibly microservices for ingestion vs modeling vs API Advanced features: Real-time scoring and alerts: as soon as relevant events happen on a customer journey (e.g. cancellation attempts, repeated complaints), update churn risk. Multi-touch attribution & journey mapping: visualize how customer moved across channels; path analysis; allow filtering by segment; drop-off points. NLP sentiment analysis on support ticket / feedback to incorporate qualitative signals into churn risk. What-if experiment module: simulate interventions (e.g. offering discount, increased support) and estimate retention lifts. User-facing reports & dashboards for customer success / marketing team; ability to share or export; role permissions.
